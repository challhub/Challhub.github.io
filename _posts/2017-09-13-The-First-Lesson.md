    <td>One of my best strategies that I learnt was assigning me and my partner, Rui, different roles to work on. For example,one person would read out the code while the other person coded it into the fuzebox. This meant that we could be extremely quick at doing it, breaking the speed of what one person could do by using two instead. This gave us a great advantage in accuracy as well, as we had two people checking our work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of our main problems was a calamity specific to working in pairs. The issue was that by using two people we often got mixed up, as one person was reading too fast. Although, we did manage to solve this, it was only by spending a lot of time coding, and was out of habit more than necessity or trying extremely hard. This was our only difficulty that we had.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I always pay attention to what other people are saying, so that when we work together it is as seamless as possible. This will also only work if I find another partner that has a similar ability to me, or better. Hopefully I will be able fulfill this next next time.</td>

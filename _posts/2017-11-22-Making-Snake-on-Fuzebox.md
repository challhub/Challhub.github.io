    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to begin to copy the code and create the arcade game, Snake.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, and myself and my partner managed to complete the first page of coding and get halfway into the second page.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>One of my best strategies for learning was making sure that myself and my partner were always copying down the code correctly. The way we did this was that one person would type the code in and the other would be constantly comparing it to the code that we had been given to check that that the code was correct. We would swap roles every 15 lines.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although this strategy allowed myself and myself and my partner to type quickly and efficiently it also meant that I did not fully comprehend what the code that we were typing meant. This meant that if I needed to make this code again I would only know what the code was, so I would not actually now the theory behind it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I am focusing on copying the code down correctly to minimise the chance of missing something out and replacing it with something that I have came up with myself. I will also make sure that when writing the code I am understanding what I am typing.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, and I got further as I reached page 55, which was what my partner got up to in the lesson.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>One of my best strategies for learning was making sure that I always read and reread the work that I was doing. I also searched up things that I did not know to make sure that I was ready for the lesson that I had next week. I also made sure that I contacted and messaged my friends to keep up with what happened in the lessons. This meant I know what is going to happen next week</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of my main problems that I had was not paying attention to the task that I had given myself, and not being in a school working environment made me unsure and distracted of what I wanted myself to do. I also wasn't in the lesson which meant that I did not know about many of the other extra things that had been said in the lesson </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I always pay attention to the task given instead of getting distracted by everyday objects. I will also try to find a relaxed working environment that I work in easily as well as good in</td>

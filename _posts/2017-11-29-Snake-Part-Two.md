    <td>A semi finished snake code on fuzebox. </td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To be able to play my game to a certain extent by the end of the lesson</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No, but that was only because my partner and I did not complete the code entirely</td>

  <tr>
    <td>One of my best strategies for learning was due to the technology that we used. I would have my ipad next to the screen I was using, which would be displaying the code that I needed to copy down. Whilst I was doing this my partner would have his computer screen up, with an image of the code that I was copying on his screen. This meant that I could be typing whilst he was checking my code</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> One of the problems that I had whilst working was that this meant that the person who was checking the code had a rather banal experience. It was unfair as all he was doing is checking and comparing the code to what I was doing, rather than typing in the code like the driver was. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that my partner and I swap over every 10 minutes, so it is fair, and the monotonous task is shared out equally. I will also make sure that the person who is checking what I am typing is doing his job instead of nothing</td>

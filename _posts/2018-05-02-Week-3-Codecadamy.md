  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Entering year eight with a basic knowledge of ICT, such as how to work sites such as scratch, but none on creating code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this year?</td>
    <td>To have learnt something new in my class and get over my nerve of getting things wrong.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Almost, as I learnt many new things over the school but I am still working on the latter.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I mainly learnt from just having a go and keeping trying to succeed. Even though I failed at the start I had another go until I reached my target for the lesson.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to work on not losing effort when things don't go my way.  I need to know that making mistakes is how I learn. To do this I will attempt to keep on going until I finally find a solution.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try as hard as I can to not lose confidence when things donâ€™t work and keep on going until
I fix things.  </td>

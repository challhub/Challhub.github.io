    <td>One of my best strategies for learning that I used today was being inquisitive, and asking questions, a task that I do not usually complete. I think that I also learnt that getting things wrong is not a bad thing, as it is not only a learning opportunity, but it also allows you to adapt to what others have said, which I found improved my learning.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on listening to the teacher, and not getting distracted by the other activities going on around me. I also need to listen to the question that is being asked and not just believing that the question will always be the same to what we have been discussing with my classmates. My final improvement is to make sure that I am always being attentive and listening, instead of forgetting crucial points.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that I am always listening to the question that is being asked so that I can find answer, or at least attempt to. I will also be attentive and always focus on the teacher and the work that is being assigned, rather than getting distracted by other people and classroom objects around me.</td>

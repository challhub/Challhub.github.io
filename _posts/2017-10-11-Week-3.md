(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>One of my best strategies for learning was making sure that I always read and reread the work that I was doing, as if I made a mistake it would hinder not only myself and my partner, but what we achieved in the lesson</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of my main problems that I had was not paying attention to the task that I had been given, as it made me slow down and not be reading out the things that I should have done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I always pay attention to the task given instead of getting distracted by everyday objects. I will also try to find a relaxed working environment that I work in easily as well as good in</td>

    <td>One of my best strategies for learning was making sure that I always rechecked my work to make sure that the code I was doing was correct. I also found shortcuts in what I was doing which allowed me to do things as quick as possible, whilst being accurate. This strategy was very efficient as it let me do two things extremely quickly. Although, this also counteracted into one of my other problems that I shall see later on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of my main problems that I had was not paying attention to the task given, which made me sometimes continue something for a time that exceeded ten minutes,which made me sometimes fall behind on what I was doing. This was because I was only paying attention to the screen and not the teacher. However, this was also a good thing as it meant that I was learning a lot in my work and doing extra things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I always pay attention to the task given instead of trying to piece things together to come up with a slightly different objective. I will always listen to what the teacher is saying as if I don't it may sometimes result in me getting things wrong or doing the opposite to the task given. Hopefully I will be able to do this next time so that I can overall become a better student and learn more.</td>
